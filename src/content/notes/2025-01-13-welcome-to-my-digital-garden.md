Welcome! This is my digital garden — a place where I cultivate ideas, share learnings, and collect resources I find valuable.

## What is a Digital Garden?

Unlike a traditional blog with polished, finished posts, a digital garden is more like a personal wiki. Ideas here grow over time. Some notes are seeds — quick thoughts that might develop later. Others are more fully formed.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Notes** — Essays, links, code snippets, and quick thoughts
- **Projects** — Things I'm building with learnings and outcomes
