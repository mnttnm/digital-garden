I recently developed an application called **Parent Co-Teacher** for the Gemini hackathon. The core idea behind this project is to empower parents to assist their children with homework and studies at home, even if the parents are not proficient in the language (primarily English) or the specific subject content. This tool aims to bridge potential educational gaps by providing accessible support.
