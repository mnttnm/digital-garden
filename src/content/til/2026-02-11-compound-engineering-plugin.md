Finally got around to installing the [Compound Engineering plugin](https://every.to/guides/compound-engineering) from Every.to. It's a Claude Code plugin that provides a structured workflow for AI-assisted development.

If you don't want to build your own plan → implement → test → review setup, this is a great starting point. The philosophy emerged from building Cora (an AI chief of staff for email) and battle-testing patterns across many pull requests. The core idea is the 40-10-30-20 split: 40% planning, 10% working, 30% reviewing, 20% compounding (documenting solutions for reuse).

The plugin comes with specialized agents for different phases—architecture analysis, code review, and solution documentation. Worth trying if you want more structure in your AI-assisted coding workflow.
