Welcome! This is my digital garden — a place where I cultivate ideas, share learnings, and collect resources I find valuable.

## What is a Digital Garden?

Unlike a traditional blog with polished, finished posts, a digital garden is more like a personal wiki. Ideas here grow over time. Some notes are seeds — quick thoughts that might develop later. Others are more fully formed.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Writing** — Longer articles and tutorials on topics I'm exploring
- **TIL (Today I Learned)** — Quick notes on small discoveries
- **Resources** — Curated links to articles, tools, and videos I recommend
- **Projects** — Updates on things I'm building

## Stay Updated

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore.
